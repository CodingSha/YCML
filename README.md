#YCML

YCML is a Machine Learning framework in Objective-C and Swift.
Currently, it implements Feed-Forward Nets, trained either using the Extreme Learning Machines (ELM) training algorithm [1], or Backpropagation [2] with Gradient Descent.

ELMs are Feed-Forward Networks with a single hidden layer. Their hidden layer weights are initialized randomly, and the output linear weights are determined analytically.

More algorithms soon to follow. 

##Features

- Embedded model input/output normalization facility.
- Generic Supervised Learning base class that can accommodate a variety of algorithms.
- Based on [YCMatrix](https://github.com/yconst/YCMatrix), a matrix library that makes use of the Accelerate Framework.

##Getting started

Import the project in your workspace, or compile the framework
and import. YCML depends on YCMatrix, which has been included as a
Git submodule.

Note: I was planning to use Cocoapods for facilitating deployment, but, to be honest, I had a really hard time using it the way I would like (e.g. with local Pods etc.).
I found that Cocoapods is riddled with frequent changes that break the API, and render much of the information online useless. As such, I decided not to spend more time with it and went with git submodules.

##Getting Help

YCML documentation is compiled using Appledoc. 

##Example Usage

YCML models and trainers make use of the YCMatrix class to define input and output datasets. Both for input as well as for output, each matrix column defines a single training example.

There are plans to implement a proper dataframe class in the future, in addition to the matrix class, as part of the library.

Basic training and activation (Objective-C):

    #import "YCML/YCML.h"
    #import "YCMatrix/YCMatrix.h"
    #import "YCMatrix/YCMatrix+Manipulate.h"
    #import "YCMatrix/YCMatrix+Advanced.h"

    (...)

    YCMatrix *trainingData   = [self matrixWithCSVName:@"housing" removeFirst:YES];
    YCMatrix *trainingOutput = [trainingData getRow:13];
    YCMatrix *trainingInput  = [trainingData removeRow:13];
    YCELMTrainer *trainer    = [YCELMTrainer trainer];

    YCFFN *model = (YCFFN *)[trainer train:nil inputMatrix:trainingInput outputMatrix:trainingOutput];

    YCMatrix *predictedOutput = [model activateWithMatrix:trainingInput];

A more advanced example, using cross-validation (Objective-C):

    YCMatrix *trainingData   = [self matrixWithCSVName:@"housing" removeFirst:YES];
    [trainingData shuffleColumns];
    YCMatrix *cvData         = [trainingData matrixWithColumnsInRange:NSMakeRange(trainingData.columns - 20, 19)];
    trainingData             = [trainingData matrixWithColumnsInRange:NSMakeRange(0, trainingData.columns - 20)];
    YCMatrix *trainingOutput = [trainingData getRow:13];
    YCMatrix *trainingInput  = [trainingData removeRow:13];
    YCMatrix *cvOutput       = [cvData getRow:13];
    YCMatrix *cvInput        = [cvData removeRow:13];
    YCELMTrainer *trainer    = [YCELMTrainer trainer];
    trainer.settings[@"C"]   = @8;
    trainer.settings[@"Hidden Layer Size"] = @1000

    YCFFN *model = (YCFFN *)[trainer train:nil inputMatrix:trainingInput outputMatrix:trainingOutput];

    YCMatrix *predictedOutput = [model activateWithMatrix:cvInput];

    [predictedOutput subtract:cvOutput];
    [predictedOutput elementWiseMultiply:predictedOutput];
    double RMSE = sqrt( (1.0/[predictedOutput count]) * [predictedOutput sum] );

The last example written in Swift:

    var trainingData = self.matrixWithCSVName("housing", removeFirst: true)
    trainingData.shuffleColumns()
    var cvData = trainingData.matrixWithColumnsInRange(NSMakeRange(trainingData.columns-20, 19))
    trainingData = trainingData.matrixWithColumnsInRange(NSMakeRange(0, trainingData.columns-20))
    var trainingOutput = trainingData.getRow(13)
    var trainingInput = trainingData.removeRow(13)
    var cvOutput = cvData.getRow(13)
    var cvInput = cvData.removeRow(13)
    var trainer = YCELMTrainer()
    trainer.settings["C"] = 8
    trainer.settings["Hidden Layer Size"] = 1000

    var model = trainer.train(nil, inputMatrix: trainingInput, outputMatrix: trainingOutput)

    var predictedOutput = model.activateWithMatrix(cvInput)

    predictedOutput.subtract(cvOutput)
    predictedOutput.elementWiseMultiply(predictedOutput)
    var RMSE = sqrt(1.0 / Double(predictedOutput.columns) * predictedOutput.sum)
    NSLog("%@", RMSE)
    XCTAssertLessThan(RMSE, 9.0, "RMSE above threshold")
